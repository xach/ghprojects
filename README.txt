"ghprojects" is a half-baked program to consume github's api, e.g.
https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=language:lisp+created:2013-11-02
and produce an Atom feed. It was written hastily and without didactic
value in mind.

It is available under an MIT-style license. See the file LICENSE.txt
for details.
